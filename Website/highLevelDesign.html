</u></b></h1>
    <h3>High-Level Design</h3>

    <div class="col-md-12">

        <p>
            Formulating a high-level design for the central food ordering portals was an important and tricky part. Wrong architecture design could waste all the future work and will lose all the efforts in terms of cost and development time. Looking at the functional and nonfunctional requirements, it was evident that there would be 3 parts of the system:
            <ol>
                <li> Front-end or UI of the application</li>
                <li> Back-end logic for providing the required functionality of the portal</li>
                <li> Database support to store all the data in a coherent way and to make data manipulation more efficient</li>
            </ol>
             The high level structure which would be used to design this web application will be Model-View-Template structure. 
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
            <img style="height: 66%" class="col-md-8" src="./img/Module.drawio.png">
        </div>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
        <pre><i>(Figure 5)</i> Module Overview of our system</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
        The UI part of the portal will be the part which would be presented to the user when he connects to the web app. All user interaction will be carried out through this UI. UI will be responsible for taking the input from the user and displaying the generated output to the user. The UI part will be designed using Angular JS which is one of the prominent frontend frameworks. The rationale behind choosing this as the front-end framework is it has strong support for asynchronous HTML forms and many inbuilt functionalities to make the UI more responsive, low latency and efficient. All the login forms and dining hall forms, vendor forms will be rendered on UI. 
       </p>
        <p>
            The back-end of the system will contain core logic which will yield the results required to satisfy all the requirements. These requirements include but are not limited to, processing the input taken from the UI via different forms, handling 3 modules of the back-end which are Vendor, Southgate and Dining Hall and their intended needs, connecting to external SQL database and manipulating the data via queries. The back-end will be developed in Django Framework which has inbuilt support for AngularJS and SQL database. The first choice of back-end framework was Django as Django has an advanced library support in Python, which would be essential for designing the web application. Apart from that, in future it will be easy to integrate ML-OPS into the system and Django will also help in building scalable applications with low latency and fast asynchronous systems. Django has inbuilt support for Microsoft Azure, the cloud service where we plan to deploy the website after its successful completion. 

        </p>
        <p>
        The database support is needed for saving all the dining hall information, orders and product list, different users, and handling all the monetary part related to 3 modules Dining Halls, Southgate and Vendor. The database which will be used for the application is SQL database. The reason behind choosing SQL database is the requirement of transactional data. Also, we donâ€™t really want horizontal scaling since the scope of our application is limited to VT. SQL will give an option for vertical scaling with advanced secure hashing methods to save the important data. SQL gets an edge over traditional NoSQL databases because of its support for normalization and stricter access control rules. SQL also has low latency for complex queries which requires multiple joins. 
       </p>
        <p>
        Therefore, overall the high-level architecture will contain Frontend, Backend and Database support.
