                    Our system is targeted to ease the working of the Southgate Dining hall. It will automate the centralized food ordering system across Virginia Tech Dining Halls. As part of our system, Southgate would be the super admin of the portal. The Manager would regularly update the food products that need to be ordered from the vendor. Each Dining hall will have its own account on the Food Ordering Portal. The manager of each dining hall is responsible for requesting the food product and its minimum and desired quantity via the portal. At 1 PM the system stops taking requests for the day, and sends an automated request for the food items to the respective vendors. The best vendor responds with the available item and the system sends out a confirmation to the dining halls about the expected items for the next day. Once the items have been delivered, the portal reflects the delivery to each dining hall. <br> <br>

	One of our teammates is currently working as the Student Manager at the Southgate Dining hall. The current food ordering system that is being used was built in the 1980s and comes with lots of drawbacks. Firstly, once an item has been added to the system, it cannot be deleted, even if it’s not required by VT dining halls. There are currently more than 50 items that have been discontinued for years. The portal doesn’t have a direct vendor interaction and thus the manager of Southgate needs to contact each vendor every day and place an order manually and obtain their best price. Our new portal would completely automate this process. Moreover, our system would eliminate the manual labor that the manager needs to go through to print the labels, saving 2hrs of work. Finally, managers currently need to call each dining hall about the availability of items and delivery. The entire system in all would reduce the workload of the manager by an average of 5 hrs each day. <br> <br>

	Currently, our proposed system has not been implemented, thus this is a pretty novel idea. Currently, the vendor side has its own separate system called FoodPro, but it doesn’t reduce the workload for the managers. Our new system brings everyone on the same platform by automating the entire food ordering process. <br> <br>

	We are proposing a system that heavily depends on choosing the correct architectural style. Our system consists of three modules (dining halls, Southgate, and vendors) and we need our system to work in the desired way. Our system requirements need us to add new features and provide abstraction and interaction between modules. This would not be possible if we don’t choose the correct architectural style. <br> <br>
