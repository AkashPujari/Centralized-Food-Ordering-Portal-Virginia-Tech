</u></b></h1>

    <div class="col-md-12">

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <br> 
        <div class="col-md-12">

            <p style="text-align: justify">
                Our system is targeted to ease the working of the Southgate Dining hall. It will automate the centralized food ordering system across Virginia Tech Dining Halls. As part of our system, Southgate would be the super admin of the portal. The Manager would regularly update the food products that need to be ordered from the vendor. Each Dining hall will have its own account on the Food Ordering Portal. The manager of each dining hall is responsible for requesting the food product and its minimum and desired quantity via the portal. At 1 PM the system stops taking requests for the day, and sends an automated request for the food items to the respective vendors. The best vendor responds with the available item and the system sends out a confirmation to the dining halls about the expected items for the next day. Once the items have been delivered, the portal reflects the delivery to each dining hall. <br> <br>

One of our teammates is currently working as the Student Manager at the Southgate Dining hall. The current food ordering system that is being used was built in the 1980s and comes with lots of drawbacks. Firstly, once an item has been added to the system, it cannot be deleted, even if it’s not required by VT dining halls. There are currently more than 50 items that have been discontinued for years. The portal doesn’t have a direct vendor interaction and thus the manager of Southgate needs to contact each vendor every day and place an order manually and obtain their best price. Our new portal would completely automate this process. Moreover, our system would eliminate the manual labor that the manager needs to go through to print the labels, saving 2hrs of work. Finally, managers currently need to call each dining hall about the availability of items and delivery. The entire system in all would reduce the workload of the manager by an average of 5 hrs each day. <br> <br>

Currently, our proposed system has not been implemented, thus this is a pretty novel idea. Currently, the vendor side has its own separate system called FoodPro, but it doesn’t reduce the workload for the managers. Our new system brings everyone on the same platform by automating the entire food ordering process. <br> <br>

We are proposing a system that heavily depends on choosing the correct architectural style. Our system consists of three modules (dining halls, Southgate, and vendors) and we need our system to work in the desired way. Our system requirements need us to add new features and provide abstraction and interaction between modules. This would not be possible if we don’t choose the correct architectural style. <br> <br>

            <div class="col-md-12">
        
                <p>
                    The primary intended user of this Food Ordering Portal is VT Dining services. Primarily all the VT dining halls under dining services including Southgate Dining Hall. The secondary user will include the different Vendors who are interested in selling their produce to Southgate. This system will try to automate the processes that Southgate manager is doing manually thereby saving 2-3 hrs of Southgate Manager on a day to day basis. 
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Southgate manager acts as the backbone of the VT dining Services. The main tasks of Southgate Manager includes, taking orders from all the dining halls for day to day basis. After retrieving orders from the dining halls, the combined order is placed to a vendor via Foodpro web service. (FoodPro is a paid subscription where you have to email the vendor for placing the order) If there are any unforeseen circumstances, the manager has to manually mail every dining hall to inform them about the intricacies. At 1 PM everyday Manager has to manually create the labels for the product for the next day using MS WORD. This whole manual process usually takes about 2-3 hrs daily. If there was an automated system to address this, we could easily save 2-3 hrs daily.  </li> <br>

                        <li>Dining Hall managers have to manually take the orders from each and every food counter manager to get the consolidated amount required for each of the dining halls. Then, he has to mail his requirements to the Southgate manager before 12:30 PM everyday. If there are any special requirements, the special requirements have to be mailed to the Southgate Manager 2 days before the actual need. If he needs to cancel any order, he has to call the Southgate Office and let them know the cancellations over the phone call. The usual day of managers includes at least 2 hrs of manual work which if automated can do wonders for them.</li><br>

                        <li>Vendors who are interested in selling their produce to Southgate Hall, have to be dependent on the third party food app service FoodPro. Everyday, they will get an email from the Southagte Manager with the list of required produce for the next day. If the vendor has the product in the warehouse, he has to reply to the Southgate Manager to accept the order. The cut off time to send the items to Southgate Dining hall is 6 AM in the morning. If they do not have all the items requested, they cannot accept the order. The system works like a 0/1 knapsack. If the vendor has the partial requested order, he cannot accept the order. </li>

        <h3>High-Level Design</h3>

    <div class="col-md-12">

        <p>
            Formulating a high-level design for the central food ordering portals was an important and tricky part. Wrong architecture design could waste all the future work and will lose all the efforts in terms of cost and development time. Looking at the functional and nonfunctional requirements, it was evident that there would be 3 parts of the system:
            <ol>
                <li> Front-end or UI of the application</li>
                <li> Back-end logic for providing the required functionality of the portal</li>
                <li> Database support to store all the data in a coherent way and to make data manipulation more efficient</li>
            </ol>
             The high level structure which would be used to design this web application will be Model-View-Template structure. 
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
            <img style="height: 66%" class="col-md-8" src="./img/Module.drawio.png">
        </div>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
        <pre><i>(Figure 5)</i> Module Overview of our system</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
        The UI part of the portal will be the part which would be presented to the user when he connects to the web app. All user interaction will be carried out through this UI. UI will be responsible for taking the input from the user and displaying the generated output to the user. The UI part will be designed using Angular JS which is one of the prominent frontend frameworks. The rationale behind choosing this as the front-end framework is it has strong support for asynchronous HTML forms and many inbuilt functionalities to make the UI more responsive, low latency and efficient. All the login forms and dining hall forms, vendor forms will be rendered on UI. 
       </p>
        <p>
            The back-end of the system will contain core logic which will yield the results required to satisfy all the requirements. These requirements include but are not limited to, processing the input taken from the UI via different forms, handling 3 modules of the back-end which are Vendor, Southgate and Dining Hall and their intended needs, connecting to external SQL database and manipulating the data via queries. The back-end will be developed in Django Framework which has inbuilt support for AngularJS and SQL database. The first choice of back-end framework was Django as Django has an advanced library support in Python, which would be essential for designing the web application. Apart from that, in future it will be easy to integrate ML-OPS into the system and Django will also help in building scalable applications with low latency and fast asynchronous systems. Django has inbuilt support for Microsoft Azure, the cloud service where we plan to deploy the website after its successful completion. 

        </p>
        <p>
        The database support is needed for saving all the dining hall information, orders and product list, different users, and handling all the monetary part related to 3 modules Dining Halls, Southgate and Vendor. The database which will be used for the application is SQL database. The reason behind choosing SQL database is the requirement of transactional data. Also, we don’t really want horizontal scaling since the scope of our application is limited to VT. SQL will give an option for vertical scaling with advanced secure hashing methods to save the important data. SQL gets an edge over traditional NoSQL databases because of its support for normalization and stricter access control rules. SQL also has low latency for complex queries which requires multiple joins. 
       </p>
        <p>
        Therefore, overall the high-level architecture will contain Frontend, Backend and Database support. 
        </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Modules</h3>

    <div class="col-md-12">

        <p>
            Combining the individual modules together renders a fully functioning software system for our centralized food ordering portal.  The basic workflow of the capture image process is as follows (Figure 6):
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Dining hall manager logs in to the system.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dining hall manager checks the availability of products in the portal. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Dining hall manager places the order and requests for items that are unavailable but necessary. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Southgate manager logs in to the system at 1pm and retrieves the orders and places them in the portal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Southgate manager prints the labels for the corresponding orders. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Vendor logs in to the system and checks the orders. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Vendor accepts the orders and the system responds with confirmation of items about to arrive the next day to the Southgate manager.
            </li>
            <li>
                Southgate manager updates the portal to reflect the availability of the items.
            </li>
            <li>
                Vendor sends the order the next day at 6am and the Southgate manager gives confirmation of delivery to the Dining hall managers on the portal. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Module 1 - Southgate Manager</h5>
        <p>
            The Southgate manager is responsible for retrieving the orders sent by the dining hall managers and then placing the orders in the portal at 1pm. He then prints the labels for the corresponding orders. The southgate manager updates the portal to reflect the availability of the items once the system responds with confirmation of the items after the orders are accepted by the vendors. The southgate manager then gives a confirmation of delivery to the dining hall managers on the portal once the orders arrive the next day at 6am.     
        </p>

        <h5>Design Element - DE-1</h5>
        <p>
            The problem domain for this module can be decomposed into objects from the domain.  As seen in Figure 7, the centralized food ordering portal can be broken into the following objects:

        <h5>Module 2 - Dining Hall Manager</h5>
        <p>
            The dining hall manager is responsible for placing the orders in the system for their respective dining halls after checking the availability of products in the portal. The dining hall manager also requests for items that are unavailable but necessary for the dining hall.         </p>
        <h5>Design Element - DE-2</h5>
        <p>
            The problem domain for this module can be decomposed into objects from the domain.  As seen in Figure 9, the centralized food ordering portal can be broken into the following objects:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Dining Hall Manager: - 
                This sub-module is responsible for handling all the requirements related to the Dining Hall Manager Role. These include logging in in the system, retrieving orders from different food stalls inside respective dining halls and submitting the consolidated order in the food app before 1 PM.
            </li>
            <li>
                Food App: - 
Similar to the Southgate Manager module, the food app will have different HTML forms which will be used for handling the communication between dining halls, Southgate Manager and Vendor.  

            </li>
            
            <li>
                Database: - In the database, we will store the Manager Table which will contain all the necessary information for each Manager including Southgate Manager. Apart from that, we will have a table Product List which will contain all the active products which could be added to the updated product list. If there are any special orders, after checking the product list, Dining Hall Manager will request the Southgate. 
            </li>
      
        </ol>

        <p>
            The Dining Hall Manager needs to verify himself before logging in the system. Oauth 2.0 will be used to verify the manager credentials in the backend by the system. Once he is successfully logged in, he will have access to the 2 HTML forms within the system. HTMLA and HTMLB. HTMLA will be used for placing the orders to the southgate. If he has any add ons or special requests, a dedicated section will be provided in the HTMLA form, where he can write comments for special requests. EVeryday, Southgate will deliver the previous day’s placed orders in the Morning. Once the orders have been received in each of the dining halls, they will verify the respective orders and then, the Dining Hall Manager will confirm the delivery of the products using HTMLB form. 
        </p>

        <h5>Module 3 - Vendor</h5>
        <p>
            The vendor is responsible for accepting the orders that have been placed in the portal by the Southgate manager. The vendor sends the orders the next day at 6 AM. 
        </p>

        <h5>Design Element - DE-3</h5>
        <p>
            The problem domain for this module can be decomposed into objects from the domain.  As seen in Figure 11, the centralized food ordering portal can be broken into the following objects:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Vendor: - Vendors will have all the data related to Vendor and will try to manage the Vendor. This will include, Vendor log in, Vendor information etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Store: - This module will have all the information about a particular Vendors warehouse unit. What is currently present in the warehouse and stuff related to it. It will make Vendors life easy to check whether he has enough inventory in his warehouse to accept the order. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Food App: - Similar to the Southgate Manager module, the food app will have different HTML forms which will be used for handling the communication between dining halls, Southgate Manager and Vendor.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Database: - In the database, we will store the Vendor Table which will contain all the necessary information for each of the Vendors. Each Vendor will have a Store table associated which will store all the information regarding the Vendor’s warehouse. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The Vendor will Login in in the portal. The system will verify his credentials using Oauth 2.0 and once he is verified, he will be allowed in the system. On the Food App portal, Vendor can add and see the notes regarding the previous orders. This will be a basic asynchronous text field where Vendor or Southgate Manager can add notes. After 1PM everyday, Vendor will be notified as soon as the Southgate Manager posts the order for the next day. Vendor can go through the order list for the next day and check if he has the required produce in his warehouse. If he does, he will press the accept the order button. The confirmation will be generated for that particular Vendor (System will use Vendor ID for this) and it will be sent to Southgate Manager.

        <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
        <br>
        <div class="col-md-12">
    
            <p>
                Centralized Food Ordering system is a website which aims to automate the current manual process at VT dining halls which essentially costs all the dining hall managers about 2-3 hrs everyday. The website essentially will have 3 main components, Front-end, Back-end and Database. These components are essential for the working of all the 3 modules of the system which are Southgate Manager, DIning Halls and Vendor. Front End of the system is basically the UI part of the system through which the user interaction will be taken into the system and computed output will be reflected back on the UI. Database will store all the information required for the working of the website in different table formats. Back-end part of the system will cover the core logic which will compute the necessary output to satisfy all the requirements. 
    
    MVT architecture allows the website to satisfy all the functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements like FR1, FR2 will need database queries which fall under Model when following MVT pattern. FR3, FR4 will be using database as well as back-end logic which will be using different Views. FR6, FR7, FR8 will be using UI or front end which will be covered in different Templates. Apart from that NFR1 would use back-end as well as database, NFR7, NFR8 will take support from front-end or Templates. Thus, the MVT choice of architecture makes the job more easy and efficient. 
    
            </p>
    
            <br>
            <h5>Function 1: Authentication Mechanism</h5>
            <p>
                The FR1 and FR2 are related with the user authentication for the food application. User authentication is essential for every website to protect the system from non authenticated use. The authentication mechanism for our system will be based on the OAUTH 2.0 architecture. OAUTH 2.0 is supported under Django which provides inbuilt libraries for implementing the authentication. The database, will have different tables which will contain the necessary information regarding the user. The tables will differ according to roles. I.e Dining Manager table will store the information (Basically Login credentials) related to the Managers of VT dining Halls. Vendor table will contain the information related to Vendors. Whenever, user tries to login, he will have to fill a login form which will ask the user for username and password. This form will be rendered on the Front-end. Once a user presses the submit button, the information will be passed to the backend where the database will be queried to check if the login credentials match the entries present in the respective tables. If it is successful, the user will be redirected to the landing page or else he will get an alert message stating that either password or username is incorrect, please try again. 
    
            </p>
    
            <br>
            <h5>Function 2: Ordering Forms</h5>
            <p>
                The FR3 and FR4 are related to communicating between Dining Hall and Southgate Manager. The Southgate Manager regularly updates this form to add new products that might be available for dining halls. The database is instantly changed to reflect the new products. It also deletes non required products and the database would delete the product entry. Once the Dining Hall manager opens the form they have the option of requesting the quantity of the product. The database would update the required quantity of the item. When multiple dining halls request the same product, the database sums up the total quantity and returns it to the Southgate Manager. This helps the manager to place the correct quatity of order tot the vendor. Apart from this dining hall managers have the option of requesting southgate to add a new item that isint already available in the database. Here the request product can be directly added to the database by the southgate manager by accepting the request from the dining halls.
    
            </p>
    
            <br>
            <h5>Function 3: Retrieving and Placing an Order</h5>
            <p>
                The FR5 and FR8 are crucial to playing the order and confirming the order. When the orders are retrieved from the database the Southgate Manager places this order with the vendor. The vendor would receive the total order and they would then send a confirmation of what orders they can fulfill. The database would manage the updates and let the southgate manager know about the expected order. The database would automatically allocate the dining halls with the products and quantity based on the request. It would also print the labels for sending the products to the dining halls. Incase the received quantity is less than the expected quantity, based on daily consumption, the distribution algorithm would automatically assign the products to the dining halls and update the database. The dining hall managers would also be able to confirm the delivery of the product once they receive it.
            </p>
    
            <br>
            <h5>Function 4: Vendor Portal</h5>
            <p>
                The FR6 and FR7 deals with the vendor side of the application. The vendor needs to confirm the receipt of the order and once the vendor confirms that the portal would reflect the same. As mentioned above the algorith would sort the orders and the database would reflect the same. It would also assist in communicating between vendor and Southgate Manager for providing notes and comments on the products. All these would be stored in our database. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>
                Centralized Food Ordering System is a system dedicated to VT Dining halls and Vendors interested to sell their products to VT Dining Services. This system automates the ordering process thereby reducing the manual workload of Managers and Vendors. The system has 3 dedicated modules i.e. Southgate Module, Vendor Module and Dining Hall module. Each of these modules cater to different intended users. The architecture that was followed by us for designing the system is MVT architectural design. The MVT architecture gives flexibility to integrate all the modules under one umbrella and seamless interaction between them. Model is where we store the database, View is used to write back-end logic and Templates will be HTML files which will be used in the front-end. MVT architecture makes our website work faster, efficient and well suited for vertical scaling in the future.
