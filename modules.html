    <div class="col-md-12">

        <p>
            Combining the individual modules together renders a fully functioning software system for our centralized food ordering portal.  The basic workflow of the capture image process is as follows (Figure 6):
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Dining hall manager logs in to the system.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dining hall manager checks the availability of products in the portal. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Dining hall manager places the order and requests for items that are unavailable but necessary. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Southgate manager logs in to the system at 1pm and retrieves the orders and places them in the portal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Southgate manager prints the labels for the corresponding orders. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Vendor logs in to the system and checks the orders. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Vendor accepts the orders and the system responds with confirmation of items about to arrive the next day to the Southgate manager.
            </li>
            <li>
                Southgate manager updates the portal to reflect the availability of the items.
            </li>
            <li>
                Vendor sends the order the next day at 6am and the Southgate manager gives confirmation of delivery to the Dining hall managers on the portal. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Module 1 - Southgate Manager</h5>
        <p>
            The Southgate manager is responsible for retrieving the orders sent by the dining hall managers and then placing the orders in the portal at 1pm. He then prints the labels for the corresponding orders. The southgate manager updates the portal to reflect the availability of the items once the system responds with confirmation of the items after the orders are accepted by the vendors. The southgate manager then gives a confirmation of delivery to the dining hall managers on the portal once the orders arrive the next day at 6am.     
        </p>

        <h5>Design Element - DE-1</h5>
        <p>
            The problem domain for this module can be decomposed into objects from the domain.  As seen in Figure 7, the centralized food ordering portal can be broken into the following objects:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Southgate Manager: - this sub-module is responsible for handling all the requirements related to the Southgate Manager role. These include logging-in in the system, retrieving orders at 1PM and printing labels. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Food App: - The food applications app will have different HTML forms which will be used for handling the communication between dining halls, Southgate Manager and Vendor. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Database: - This module will store the information related to food web applications such as order list, login credentials etc. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Printer: - This module will be tailored to the external printer in Southgate Office which will be used to print labels everyday. 
            </li>

        </ol>

        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">

        <br>
        <p>
            This Southgate Manager will first Log-in in the system with his credentials. His credentials will be verified and then and then only he will be given access to the web application. Once the credentials are verified, at 1PM everyday, Southgate Manager will retrieve all orders needed         </p>

        <h5>Module 2 - Dining Hall Manager</h5>
        <p>
            The dining hall manager is responsible for placing the orders in the system for their respective dining halls after checking the availability of products in the portal. The dining hall manager also requests for items that are unavailable but necessary for the dining hall.         </p>
        <h5>Design Element - DE-2</h5>
        <p>
            The problem domain for this module can be decomposed into objects from the domain.  As seen in Figure 9, the centralized food ordering portal can be broken into the following objects:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Dining Hall Manager: - 
                This sub-module is responsible for handling all the requirements related to the Dining Hall Manager Role. These include logging in in the system, retrieving orders from different food stalls inside respective dining halls and submitting the consolidated order in the food app before 1 PM.
            </li>
            <li>
                Food App: - 
Similar to the Southgate Manager module, the food app will have different HTML forms which will be used for handling the communication between dining halls, Southgate Manager and Vendor.  

            </li>
            
            <li>
                Database: - In the database, we will store the Manager Table which will contain all the necessary information for each Manager including Southgate Manager. Apart from that, we will have a table Product List which will contain all the active products which could be added to the updated product list. If there are any special orders, after checking the product list, Dining Hall Manager will request the Southgate. 
            </li>
      
        </ol>

        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
            <img style="height: 66%" class="col-md-8" src="./img/Dining Halls-Class Diagram.drawio.png">

        <br>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
        <pre><i>(Figure 9)</i> A Class Diagram outlining the structure of the Dining Hall Manager module</pre>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Dining Hall Manager needs to verify himself before logging in the system. Oauth 2.0 will be used to verify the manager credentials in the backend by the system. Once he is successfully logged in, he will have access to the 2 HTML forms within the system. HTMLA and HTMLB. HTMLA will be used for placing the orders to the southgate. If he has any add ons or special requests, a dedicated section will be provided in the HTMLA form, where he can write comments for special requests. EVeryday, Southgate will deliver the previous day’s placed orders in the Morning. Once the orders have been received in each of the dining halls, they will verify the respective orders and then, the Dining Hall Manager will confirm the delivery of the products using HTMLB form. 
        </p>

        <h5>Module 3 - Vendor</h5>
        <p>
            The vendor is responsible for accepting the orders that have been placed in the portal by the Southgate manager. The vendor sends the orders the next day at 6 AM. 
        </p>

        <h5>Design Element - DE-3</h5>
        <p>
            The problem domain for this module can be decomposed into objects from the domain.  As seen in Figure 11, the centralized food ordering portal can be broken into the following objects:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Vendor: - Vendors will have all the data related to Vendor and will try to manage the Vendor. This will include, Vendor log in, Vendor information etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Store: - This module will have all the information about a particular Vendors warehouse unit. What is currently present in the warehouse and stuff related to it. It will make Vendors life easy to check whether he has enough inventory in his warehouse to accept the order. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Food App: - Similar to the Southgate Manager module, the food app will have different HTML forms which will be used for handling the communication between dining halls, Southgate Manager and Vendor.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Database: - In the database, we will store the Vendor Table which will contain all the necessary information for each of the Vendors. Each Vendor will have a Store table associated which will store all the information regarding the Vendor’s warehouse. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
            <img style="height: 66%" class="col-md-8" src="./img/Vendor-Class Diagram.drawio.png">

        <br>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
        <pre><i>(Figure 11)</i> A Class Diagram outlining the structure of the Vendor module</pre>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Vendor will Login in in the portal. The system will verify his credentials using Oauth 2.0 and once he is verified, he will be allowed in the system. On the Food App portal, Vendor can add and see the notes regarding the previous orders. This will be a basic asynchronous text field where Vendor or Southgate Manager can add notes. After 1PM everyday, Vendor will be notified as soon as the Southgate Manager posts the order for the next day. Vendor can go through the order list for the next day and check if he has the required produce in his warehouse. If he does, he will press the accept the order button. The confirmation will be generated for that particular Vendor (System will use Vendor ID for this) and it will be sent to Southgate Manager. 
        </p>
